# 🎓 MSc Computer Science – Academic Projects

This repository contains **major academic and research projects** completed as part of my  
**Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science**.

Each folder represents a **standalone, end-to-end project**, covering:
- Problem definition
- Data preprocessing
- Model development (ML / DL)
- Evaluation & analysis
- Deployment (where applicable)

> ⚠️ *Note: Practice projects, mini-experiments, and learning exercises are maintained in separate repositories.*
